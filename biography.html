            <summary>Early Life</summary>
            <p>Ahilyabai was born into a Marathi Hindu family to Mankoji Shinde and Sushila Shinde in Maharashtra in the village of Chandi, now Ahmednagar district. Her father was a descendant of a respected Dhangar (Gadaria) family. Mankoji Shinde served as the Patil of the village. Ahilyabai had five brothers and was first educated at home.</p>
            <p>Ahilyabai rose to prominence when Malhar Rao Holkar, a commander in the army of Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I and ruler of Malwa, stopped in Chandi on his way to Pune and saw her at a temple service. Impressed by the child's piety and character, Malhar advised his son, Khanderao, to marry her. They were wed in 1733 when he was nine or ten and she was seven or eight. They had a son, Maloji Holkar, in 1745 and a daughter, Muktabai Holkar, in 1748.</p>

            <summary>Family's rise</summary>
            <p>By the time of Ahilyabai's marriage, her father-in-law Malhar Rao Holkar had already risen from a childhood of shepherding to ruling as Subahdar over a territory comprising thirty parganas yielding high revenues. From 1748, Malhar Rao's power in Malwa allowed him to play kingmaker in northern and central India and by 1750, he was the de facto ruler of the Maratha Confederacy. He regularly received grants, including monetary tributes, land, and noble titles, from the Peshwa government in recognition of his service to the empire. His land lay north of the Narmadha on both sides of Sahyadri. In 1751, he successfully mediated a major land agreement between the Peshwa and Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur and by 1753, he was considered indispensable.</p>

            <summary>Education and military expertise</summary>
            <p>Starting in 1754, Malhar Rao kept Ahilyabai actively involved in diplomacy debates, matters of the kingdom's finances, and other problems of both the Mughal Empire and the Peshwa. Throughout her married life, she was brought up by her mother-in-law, Gautama Bai Holkar, who is credited for teaching Ahilyabai to have proper values. She trained her in administration, accounts, and politics and, in 1759, gave Ahilyabai her khasgi, or land grant.</p>
            <p>Ahilyabai's trust from her father-in-law and her military expertise are both demonstrated by a 1765 letter he wrote her during an invasion of Punjab by a Durrani Empire-Rohilla dynasty coalition led by Emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani. Malhar Rao, who was fighting in Delhi, commanded her to take heavy artillery on a military expedition to Gwalior and attack the fort at Gohad:

              "...proceed to Gwalior after crossing the Chambal. You may halt there for four or five days. You should keep your big artillery and arrange for its ammunition as much as possible... The big artillery should be kept at Gwalior and you should proceed further after making proper arrangements for it's expenses for a month. On the march you should arrange for military posts to be located for protection of the road."
              
              Ahilbayai's attack was successful.</p>

             <summary>Khanderao's death and aftermath</summary>
             <p>In 1754, Khanderao and Malhar Rao, acting on orders from Mughal Grand Vizier Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung III, laid siege to the fort at Kumher, then held by Jat Raja Suraj Mal. Suraj Mal had sided with Safdar Jang, another Mughal vazier who had rebelled against the emperor. Khanderao was inspecting his troops in an open palanquin when he was killed by cannon fire.</p>
             <p>Devastated by Khanderao's death, Alhiyabai announced she would commit sati, ritualistic suicide on his funeral pyre. Her dismayed subjects begged her to reconsider but she explained that she felt sati was the only way she could fulfill her husband's promise to accompany her all her life. Her father-in-law Malhar Rao begged:

              "Daughter, my son left me whom I raised with a hope that he would support me in my old age. Now, will you also leave me, an old man, alone to be drowned in the fathomless ocean? ... Will you also leave me without any support? Still, if you don't want to change your mind, let me die first."
              
              This convinced her to choose to live and Malhar Rao thereupon began to train her in military affairs. He died on 20 May 1766 in Alampur.</p>

        <!-- Reign -->
        <details class="bio-box">
            <summary>Reign</summary>
            <p>On 23 Aug 1766, Ahilyabai's only son, Male Rao Holkar, became ruler of Indore at age 21 when he received investiture from the Peshwa. Male Rao had reigned for just over six months when he died on 5 April 1767. Malhar Rao's adopted son Tukoji Rao Holkar was then made Subahdar on the payment of a large tribute of Indian rupees and Ahilyabai became the de facto ruler.</p>
            <p>Historical records show that groups from neighboring states, particularly the Chundawat clan of Jaipur, rebelled during this transfer of power, taking advantage of both Tukoji Rao's absence from the region and the widespread devastation wrought by the Third Battle of Panipat and its aftermath. Ahilyabai led Marantha armies against these rebellions and, despite a lack of resources and aid, won every battle.</p>
            <p>In 1791, Ahilyabai's son-in-law, Yeshwantrao Fanse, died and her daughter Muktabai committed sati on his funeral pyre.</p>

        <!-- Administration -->
        <details class="bio-box">
            <summary>Administration</summary>
            <p>In those times, the state's administration was two-sided, military and civil. The military side was again bifurcated, Tukoji Rao Holkar was the Subedar, and he had to serve Martha. Devi Ahilyabai was outspoken, proclaiming her power by declaring, "I am the daughter-in-law of Malhar Rao". The Saranjamdar system established by Malhar Rao was efficient and was recognized by the Puna authorities. Saranjamdar was a "camp within a camp" complete by itself. The state records involuntarily reveal the diplomatic and administrative skills exhibited by Devi. Justice administration was soft but speedy, practical yet spiritual, restraining yet re-forming.</p>
            <p>She transformed Indore into a progressive city, and build industries and universities. The government of India issued a stamp on 25 August 1996 in celebration of the 200th death anniversary. The Indore airport is named after Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar Airport. The city of Indore named the university Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya. Not merely in her State but indeed in other parts of India she is credited with promoting activities including repair and additions to several famous temples such as Kashi Viswanath Mandir at Varanasi, Gouri Somnath Mandir at Chola and the construction of the famous Dashashwamedh Ghat at Banaras.</p>
