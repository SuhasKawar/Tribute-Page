        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years. This has become almost legendary as a period during which perfect order and good government prevailed and the people prospered. She was a very able ruler and organizer, highly respected during her lifetime, and considered as a saint by a grateful people after her death."</p>
            <h4>— Jawaharlal Nehru, The Discovery of India (1946)</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"For thirty years her reign of peace,
              The land in blessing did increase;
              And she was blessed by every tongue,
              By stern and gentle, old and young.
              Yea, even the children at their mother's feet,
              Are taught such homely rhyming to repeat.
              In latter days from Brahma came,
              To rule our land, a noble Dame,
              Kind was her heart and bright her fame,
              And Ahilya was her honored name."</p>
            <h4>— Joanna Baillie, English Poem (1849)</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"Ahilyabai's extraordinary ability won her the regard of her subjects and of the other Maratha confederates, including Nana Phadnavis. With the natives of Malwa ... her name is sainted and she has styled an avatar or Incarnation of the Divinity. In the soberest view that can be taken of her character, she certainly appears, within her limited sphere, to have been one of the purest and most exemplary rulers that ever existed."</p>
            <h4>— John Malcolm, A Memoir of Central India</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial">
          <p>"From the original papers and letters, it becomes clear that she was the first-class politician, and that was why she readily extended her support to Mahadji Shinde. I have no hesitation in saying that without the support of Ahilyabai, Mahadji would never have gained so much importance in the politics of northern India."</p>
          <h4>— Historian Judunath Sarkar</h4>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>"Definitely no woman and no ruler are like Ahilyabai Holkar."</p>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <p>"The Great Maratha lady who affords the noblest example of wisdom, goodness, and virtue. Akbar is among male sovereigns, and Ahilyabai is among female sovereigns".</p>
